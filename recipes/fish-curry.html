    <h3>Spicy Coconut Fish Curry:</h3>
    <p>Prepare to embark on a culinary journey with this tantalizing spicy coconut fish curry. Bursting with aromatic spices, creamy coconut milk, and tender fish, this dish is a celebration of flavors that will transport you to the tropical regions where it originated.
       To start, select a firm and mild-flavored fish, such as cod, tilapia, or snapper. Cut the fish into bite-sized pieces and set them aside while you prepare the flavorful curry base.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds (680 grams) firm white fish fillets (such as cod, tilapia, or snapper), cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil (such as vegetable or coconut oil)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>Handful of curry leaves (optional, but adds authentic flavor)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet or a curry pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown and caramelized.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and curry leaves. Sauté for a minute or until the aroma of the ingredients fills the air.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, and cayenne pepper into the skillet. Stir well to coat the onions and spices with the oil, allowing them to toast and release their flavors for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the can of coconut milk, stirring to combine all the ingredients and create a creamy base for the curry. Let the mixture simmer gently for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Add the juice of one lime and a pinch of sugar to balance the flavors. Taste the curry and adjust the salt and spices according to your preference.</li>
    </ol>
