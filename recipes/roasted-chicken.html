    <h3>Roasted Lemon Herb Chicken:</h3>
    <p>The combination of juicy chicken, zesty lemon, and aromatic herbs creates a symphony of flavors that will leave you craving for more. To begin, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and prepare a roasting pan lined with aluminum foil. Place a whole chicken, rinsed and patted dry, onto the pan.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (approximately 4-5 pounds)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Juice of 2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 lemons, halved</li>
        <li>Fresh herb sprigs (rosemary, thyme, and parsley) for stuffing</li>
        <li>Optional: Roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or salad for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make this recipes :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Rinse the whole chicken under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine softened butter, minced garlic, freshly squeezed lemon juice, chopped rosemary, thyme leaves, and parsley. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Gently lift the chicken's skin and spread the herb butter mixture generously underneath, making sure to cover as much of the chicken as possible. Massage the chicken to distribute the mixture evenly.</li>
        <li>Stuff the chicken cavity with lemon halves and a few sprigs of fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>Place the prepared chicken onto the lined roasting pan and transfer it to the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Roast the chicken for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Baste the chicken with its own juices every 20 minutes to keep it moist.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is golden brown and cooked through, remove it from the oven and tent it with aluminum foil. Let it rest for about 10 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier chicken.</li>
        <li>Carve the chicken into pieces and arrange them on a serving platter. Garnish with fresh herb sprigs and lemon slices for an appealing presentation.</li>
        <li>Serve the roasted lemon herb chicken with your choice of     roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.</li>
